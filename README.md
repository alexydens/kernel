# Kernel
A kernel written from scratch in C for x86_64 based systems.\

NOTE: This is a work in progress.\
NOTE2: The examples in the readme for the includes subdirectories were written
before any of the actual code. Those files may never be created, but they 
illustrate the sort of thing that will be stored in the mentioned directory.
